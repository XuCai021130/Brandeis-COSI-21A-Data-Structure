# Brandeis COSI-21A Data Structure Class Programming Assignments

Welcome to the repository for the projects completed during the Brandeis COSI-21A Data Structure class. This repository showcases the code I developed for four different projects, demonstrating my understanding and implementation of various data structures and algorithms.

## Programming Assignments Included

1. **Elevator Simulation**: This project offers a simple simulation of an elevator system. It only moves a person to a floor and then the person will remain on that floor forever. That is, the elevator cannot pick people up from any floor besides the lobby. The building has an series of arrays of floor to store person. 

2. **Boston MBTA Train Simulation**: Here, I present a simulation of the Boston MBTA train system. It entails populating the stations with trains and passengers from text files, run the simulation, and print out a log that includes the status of the railwayâ€™s stations and the movement of trains and 
passengers. Double linked list is used to store all the stations of MBTA redline. Queues are used to store all the trains entering the station. Arrays are used to store people on the train.   

3. **AVL Tree Implementation**: The repository contains my implementation of an AVL tree. This project illustrates my grasp of balanced binary search trees and showcases my ability to develop efficient algorithms for maintaining balance.

4. **Dijkstra's Algorithm with Data Structures**: In this project, I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm, a popular graph traversal algorithm, along with essential data structures such as HashMap, Heap, and Min-Priority Queue. 

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for more details and the corresponding source code.

## Usage and Contributions

You are welcome to use the code in this repository for educational purposes or as a reference. However, please note that the code was developed as part of my coursework, and I may not actively maintain or update it.

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are appreciated!
